#### 1. Changes in lobster abundance over time and space
First, lets look at how sample lobster counts changed annually between 2012 & 2018 so we can start to see any trends on how geographic location, year, and whether sites are within a Marine Protected Area (MPA) might have an effect on lobster abundace.

```{r}
# Graph annual lobster counts by site for 2012-2018

ggplot(data = lobster_count_year, aes(x = year, 
                                      y = total_count_site)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = mpa), 
                size = 1.5,
                show.legend = TRUE) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2012, 2018, by = 1),
                     limits = c(2011.5, 2018.5),
                     expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 900, by = 150),
                     expand = c(0,0),
                     limits = c(0, 1000)) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~site_name, 
             nrow = 2,
             scales= "free_x") +

       y = "Lobster Count",
       title = "Lobster Counts by Kelp Forest Study Site",
       subtitle = "2012 - 2018") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle= 90, 
                                   hjust = 1)) +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 1),
        legend.position = c(.85,.25),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 15),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16)) 
        
```
**Figure 3.** *Annual lobster counts for each of the five sampling locations from 2012-2018. Isla Vista and Naples sampling sites are within a Marine Protected Area (MPA). Arroyo, Carpenteria, and Mohawk sampling sites are not within an MPA. Data: SBC LTER.*

Looking at the above graph there are some interesting trends that are immediately noticeable. Lobster abundance increased by a large magnitude between 2016-2017 in both the Carpenteria and Isla Vista sites. However, while lobster abundance continued to quickly rise in Isla Vista from 2017-2018, there was a sharp decline in lobsters at the Carpenteria site during the same period. All sites saw significant declines in lobster counts between 2015-2016, with the exception of the Carpenteria site where lobster abundance began a period of growth. Between 2014-2015, all sites saw an increase in lobster counts with the exception of Arroyo Quemado. This site saw relatively stable annual lobster abundance during the 2012-2018 period. 

One might reasonably assume that lobster counts would be consistently higher in all sites that are within a Marine Protected Area (MPA) as there are catch restrictions in place within their boundaries. While the graph for the Isla Vista site looks more like what we would expect to see in these locations, the Naples site graph conveys that this is not always true. Despite being within an MPA, in 2018 the Carpenteria site (outside MPA) had a larger lobster count sample than the Naples site. 


#### 2. Lobster size distrubutions in 2012 & 2018 




```{r}
# Wrangle data for lobster size distribution graph

lobster_size_site <- lobster_data_tidy %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012, 2018)) %>% 
  select(year, site, size_mm) %>% 
  group_by(year, site)
  
```

```{r}
# Part B Graph


```




```{r}
# Initial data wrangling for lobster site statistical analysis

lobster_stats_tidy <- lobster_data_tidy %>% 
  mutate(mpa = case_when(
    site %in% c("IVEE", "NAPL") ~ "MPA",
    site %in% c("AQUE", "MOHK", "CARP") ~ "non-MPA")) %>%   
  filter(year %in% c(2012, 2018)) %>% 
  select(year, site, size_mm, mpa) %>% 
  group_by(year, mpa)  

```

```{r}
# Create 2012/2018 & mpa/non-mpa data frames for statistical analysis

mpa_2012 <- lobster_stats_tidy %>% 
  filter(year == 2012, mpa == "MPA") 

nonmpa_2012 <- lobster_stats_tidy %>% 
  filter(year == 2012, mpa == "non-MPA") 

mpa_2018 <- lobster_stats_tidy %>% 
  filter(year == 2018, mpa == "MPA") 

nonmpa_2018 <- lobster_stats_tidy %>% 
  filter(year == 2018, mpa == "non-MPA") 

# Calculate Means
mean_mpa_2012 <- mean(mpa_2012$size_mm, na.rm = TRUE) 
mean_nonmpa_2012 <- mean(nonmpa_2012$size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_mpa_2018 <- mean(mpa_2018$size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_nonmpa_2018 <- mean(nonmpa_2018$size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculate Standard Deviations
sd_mpa_2012 <- sd(mpa_2012$size_mm, na.rm = TRUE) 
sd_nonmpa_2012 <- sd(nonmpa_2012$size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_mpa_2018 <- sd(mpa_2018$size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_nonmpa_2018 <- sd(nonmpa_2018$size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculate Sample Sizes
n_mpa_2012 <- sum(!is.na(mpa_2012$size_mm))
n_nonmpa_2012 <- sum(!is.na(nonmpa_2012$size_mm))
n_mpa_2018 <- sum(!is.na(mpa_2018$size_mm))
n_nonmpa_2018 <- sum(!is.na(nonmpa_2018$size_mm))

# Wrangle data for statistics summary table
lobster_summary_table <- lobster_stats_tidy %>% 
  summarize(mean_size = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_size = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            sample_n = n()) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2) 
  
```

#### 3. Do Marine Protected Areas have an affect on lobster size and abundance?

One interesting factor we would like to determine between the five sampling sites is if Marine Protected Areas (MPA) have an affect on average lobster size and abundance. Two of the five sampling sites (Isla Vista & Naples) are within the boundaries of an MPA while the other three (Arroyo, Carpenteria, Mohawk) are not. These sites were grouped together and sample statistics were calculated for the year 2012 and 2018 below (Figure 4). 

```{r}
# Make a table for lobster size sample statistics (mean, sd, sample size):

lobster_summary_table %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Year", 
                     "MPA or non-MPA Sites", 
                     "Mean lobster size (mm)",
                     "Standard Deviation (mm)",
                     "Sample Size (# of lobsters)"),
        caption = "Figure 4. Lobster size sample statistics grouped in MPA and non-MPA sites in 2012 and 2018."
        ) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered"),
                full_width = F,
                position = "center") 
 
```
In 2012, there was very few lobsters observed within MPA sites (n = 32) while in 2018 lobster observations increased nearly 38 times that amount. Lobster counts within non-MPA sites nearly tripled between 2012 and 2018 measurements. In 2012, lobsters sampled in non-MPA sites were on average 7.54 mm larger then lobsters from MPA sites. However, in 2018 lobsters sampled in non-MPA sites were on average 3.95 mm smaller then lobsters from MPA sites. Comparing average lobster size in 2018 compared to 2012 within MPA sites we see an increase in average lobster size by about 10.19 mm, or about a 15% increase.  Comparing average lobster size in 2018 compared to 2012 within non-MPA sites we see a decrease in average lobster size by about 1.3 mm, or about a 1.7% decrease. 


In addition to doing some baseline comparisons of the sample statistics above we would also like to determine if there is any statisitcally significant differences in mean lobster size between MPA and non-MPA sites. To do so, we utilized a two-sample, two-sided t-test to see if the means varied significantly in either direction. For this analysis we have selected a significance level of **Î± = 0.5** to test the following hypotheses: 


>H0: Mean size is the same between lobsters in Marine Protected Areas and those from outside of Marine Protected Areas.

>H1: Mean size is not the same between lobsters in Marine Protected Areas and those from outside of Marine Protected Areas.

##### **RESULTS:**

##### *2012 MPA vs. Non-MPA  Sites:*
```{r}
# Determine if there is a significant difference in lobster size between MPA and non-MPA sites in 2012. 

lobster_2012_mpa <- lobster_stats_tidy %>% 
  filter(year == 2012, mpa == "MPA") %>% 
  pull(size_mm)

lobster_2012_nonmpa <- lobster_stats_tidy %>% 
  filter(year == 2012, mpa == "non-MPA") %>% 
  pull(size_mm) 

lobster_2012_ttest <- t.test(lobster_2012_mpa, lobster_2012_nonmpa) # Perform two-sided t-test


d_2012 <- cohen.d(lobster_2012_mpa, lobster_2012_nonmpa) # Calculate Cohen D for 2012 mpa vs. non-mpa sites
```

Mean lobster size in MPA sites sampled in 2012 (`r round(mean_mpa_2012, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_mpa_2012, 2)`, n = `r n_mpa_2012`) differed significantly from mean lobster size in non-MPA sites in 2012 (`r round(mean_nonmpa_2012, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_nonmpa_2012, 2)`, n = `r n_nonmpa_2012`) by a two-sided, two sample t-test (t(`r round(lobster_2012_ttest$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(lobster_2012_ttest$statistic, 2)`, *p* = `r round(lobster_2012_ttest$p.value, 3)`) with a medium effect size (Cohen's *d* = `r round(d_2012$estimate, 2)`). These results show evidence suggesting that being within a MPA in 2012 had a medium effect on decreasing mean lobster size as compared to sites outside of an MPA. 

##### *2018 MPA vs. Non-MPA  Sites:*
```{r}
# Determine if there is a significant difference in lobster size between MPA and non-MPA sites in 2018. 

lobster_2018_mpa <- lobster_stats_tidy %>% 
  filter(year == 2018, mpa == "MPA") %>% 
  pull(size_mm)

lobster_2018_nonmpa <- lobster_stats_tidy %>% 
  filter(year == 2018, mpa == "non-MPA") %>% 
  pull(size_mm)

lobster_2018_ttest <- t.test(lobster_2018_mpa, lobster_2018_nonmpa) # Perform two-sided t-test

d_2018  <- cohen.d(lobster_2018_mpa, lobster_2018_nonmpa) # Calculate Cohen D for 2018 mpa vs. non-mpa sites

```

Mean lobster size in MPA sites sampled in 2018 (`r round(mean_mpa_2018, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_mpa_2018, 2)`, n = `r n_mpa_2018`) differed significantly from mean lobster size in non-MPA sites in 2018 (`r round(mean_nonmpa_2018, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_nonmpa_2018, 2)`, n = `r n_nonmpa_2012`) by a two-sided, two sample t-test (t(`r round(lobster_2018_ttest$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(lobster_2018_ttest$statistic, 2)`, *p* < 0.001) with a fairly small effect size (Cohen's *d* = `r round(d_2018$estimate, 2)`). These results show evidence suggesting that being within a MPA in 2018 had a small effect on increasing mean lobster size as compared to sites outside of an MPA. 

##### *2012 vs. 2018 MPA Sites:*
```{r}
# Determine if there a significant difference in lobsters observed in 2012 vs. 2018 for MPA sites only.

mpa_2012_2018_ttest <- t.test(lobster_2012_mpa, lobster_2018_mpa) # Perform two-sided t-test

d_12_18_mpa <- cohen.d(lobster_2012_mpa, lobster_2018_mpa) # Calculate Cohen D for 2012 vs. 2018 mpa sites

```

Mean lobster size differed significantly between MPA sites in 2018 (t(`r round(mpa_2012_2018_ttest$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(mpa_2012_2018_ttest$statistic, 2)`, *p* < 0.001) with a large effect size (Cohen's *d* = `r round(d_12_18_mpa$estimate, 2)`). These results show evidence suggesting that being within a MPA in 2012 vs. 2018 had a large effect on decreasing mean lobster size.  


##### *2012 vs. 2018 Non-MPA Sites:*
```{r}
# Determine if there is a significant difference in lobsters observed in 2012 vs. 2018 for non-MPA sites.

nonmpa_2012_2018_ttest <- t.test(lobster_2012_nonmpa, lobster_2018_nonmpa) # Perform two-sided t-test

d_12_18_nonmpa <- cohen.d(lobster_2012_nonmpa, lobster_2018_nonmpa) # Calculate Cohen D for 2012 vs. 2018 non-mpa sites

```

There is not enough evidence to conclude that mean lobster size was significantly different within non-MPA sites in 2012 vs. 2018 (t(`r round(nonmpa_2012_2018_ttest$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(nonmpa_2012_2018_ttest$statistic, 2)`, *p* = `r round(nonmpa_2012_2018_ttest$p.value, 3)`) In addition, the effect size was negligible (Cohen's *d* = `r round(d_12_18_nonmpa$estimate, 2)`).
